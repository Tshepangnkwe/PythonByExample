# Python by Example - My Coding Journey

This repository documents my hands-on practice with **150 Python challenges** from Nichola Lacey's *Python by Example*. Each solution represents a step in my programming development, focusing on practical implementation over theoretical concepts.

## What's Inside

âœ… **Core Python Skills**
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- String and list manipulation
- File handling (text/csv)

ðŸ“Š **Data Structures**
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- 2D lists and numeric arrays
- Sorting and searching algorithms

ðŸ”§ **Practical Applications**
- Random number generation
- Working with SQLite databases
- Data processing techniques

## My Approach

1. **Learn by Doing**: Each challenge solved through trial and error
2. **Progressive Difficulty**: From basic print statements to complex data handling
3. **Code Refinement**: Solutions evolve as my skills improve

## How I Use This Repo

- Daily coding practice (1-2 challenges/day)
- Reference for common Python patterns
- Tracking my problem-solving progress

*"The only way to learn programming is to program."* - My mantra while working through these exercises.
